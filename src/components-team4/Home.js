            A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment fund that pools
            money from many investors to purchase securities. The term is
            typically used in the United States, Canada, and India, while
            similar structures across the globe include the SICAV in Europe
            ('investment company with variable capital') and open-ended
            investment company (OEIC) in the UK. Mutual funds are often
            classified by their principal investments: money market funds, bond
            or fixed income funds, stock or equity funds, or hybrid funds. Funds
            may also be categorized as index funds, which are passively managed
            funds that track the performance of an index, such as a stock market
            index or bond market index, or actively managed funds, which seek to
            outperform stock market indices but generally charge higher fees.
            Primary structures of mutual funds are open-end funds, closed-end
            funds, unit investment trusts.

                      The first introduction of a mutual fund in India occurred
                      in 1963, when the{" "}

The seat of the government is located in New Delhi, the capital of India.">
                        Government of India
                      </abbr>
                      launched Unit Trust of India (UTI). UTI enjoyed a monopoly
                      in the Indian mutual fund market until 1987, when a host
                      of other government-controlled Indian financial companies
                      established their own funds, including State Bank of
                      India, Canara Bank and by Punjab National Bank.
                      <br />A mutual fund is a type of financial vehicle made up
                      of a pool of money collected from many investors to invest
                      in securities like stocks, bonds, money market
                      instruments, and other assets. Mutual funds are operated
                      by professional money managers, who allocate the fund's
                      assets and attempt to produce capital gains or income for
                      the fund's investors. A mutual fund's portfolio is
                      structured and maintained to match the investment
                      objectives stated in its prospectus.

                    <p>
                      Mutual funds in India are distributed mainly in 2 ways:-
                      <br />
                      <h5 className="text-success"> Online </h5>
                      Customers can buy mutual funds online via the
                      corresponding asset management company's website or via
                      brokers. There are a number of new platforms that have
                      come which offer direct mutual funds in their platform.
                      Subscribers can buy mutual funds from these platforms.
                      Direct mutual funds provide better returns, generally
                      between .5% to 1.5% more than their regular counterparts.
                      This is due to the fact that brokers charges are excluded
                      from the returns. A 1% deduction from a return of 12% from
                      mutual funds, leads to a 8.33% lesser return to the
                      investor, which is a huge amount.
                      <br />
                      <h5 className="text-success"> Offline </h5>
                      Most of the asset management company have an offline
                      distribution network. These distributors mainly sell
                      regular mutual funds which carry some commission on it.
                      FundsIndia, NJ, Prudent, QFund are some of the popular
                      distributors in India.
