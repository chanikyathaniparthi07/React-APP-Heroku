          Having originated in south-east England, it became the country's national sport in the 
          18th century and has developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. International matches 
          have been played since 1844 and Test cricket began, retrospectively recognised, in 1877.
          There is a consensus of expert opinion that cricket may have been invented during 
          Saxon or Norman times by children living in the Weald, an area of dense woodlands 
          and clearings in south-east England.
